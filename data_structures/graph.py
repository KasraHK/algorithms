"""Lightweight graph representation and utilities.

Graph supports arbitrary vertex ids (ints, strings, etc.). Adjacency is
stored as a dict: vertex -> list of outgoing `Edge` objects. Some algorithms
that produce matrices (e.g., Floydâ€“Warshall via adjacency matrix) still
assume integer vertex ids in [0, n-1]. For those, either use integer ids or
add a mapping layer.
